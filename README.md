This app is not functional right now because of a few dependencies. I am hosting it here majorly to have a place where I can show my work to people. This is my best work in terms of UI design, Java code and Android application. This was solely built by me with UI design inputs from the founder of the company for which I built this. 
If you want a starting point to understand the code, then look at RouteFragment.java file.

Thanks,
